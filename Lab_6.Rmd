### Learning objectives

> In today's Lab you will gain practice with the following concepts from today's class:

>- Using the **`t.test`** and **`wilcox.test`** commands to run 2-sample t-tests
- Interpreting the results of statistical significance tests
- Using **`qqnorm`** and **`qqline`** to construct normal quantile-quantile plots, and using them to assess whether data appear to be normally distributed
- Using **`fisher.test`** on 2x2 tables and interpreting the results

We'll begin by loading all the packages we might need.
```{r}
library(MASS)
library(plyr)
library(reshape)  # You may need to install this one first!
library(ggplot2)
```

### Testing means between two groups

Here is a command that generates density plots of `MPG.highway` from the Cars93 data.  Separate densities are constructed for US and non-US vehicles.  

```{r}
qplot(data = Cars93, x = MPG.highway, 
      fill = Origin, geom = "density", alpha = I(0.5))
```

**(a)** Using the Cars93 data and the `t.test()` function, run a t-test to see if average `MPG.highway` is different between US and non-US vehicles.  *Interpret the results*

Try doing this both using the formula style input and the `x`, `y` style input.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(b)** What is the confidence interval for the difference?  Interpret this confidence interval.  

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(c)** Repeat part (a) using the `wilcox.test()` function.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(d)** Are your results for (a) and (c) very different?  


### Is the data normal?

**(a)** Modify the density plot code provided in problem 1 to produce a plot with better axis labels.  Also add a title.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(b)** Does the data look to be normally distributed?  If not, describe why.

**(c)** Construct qqplots of `MPG.highway`, one plot for each `Origin` category.  Overlay a line on each plot using with `qqline()` function.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(d)** Does the data look to be normally distributed?  If not, describe why.

### Testing 2 x 2 tables

Doll and Hill's 1950 article studying the association between smoking and lung cancer contains one of the most important 2 x 2 tables in history.  

Here's their data:

```{r}
smoking <- as.table(rbind(c(688, 650), c(21, 59)))
dimnames(smoking) <- list(has.smoked = c("yes", "no"),
                    lung.cancer = c("yes","no"))
smoking
```

**(a)** Use `fisher.test()` to test if there's an association between smoking and lung cancer.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(b)** What is the odds ratio?  Interpret this quantity.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(c)** Are your findings statistically significant?  

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(d)** Write an inline code chunk similar to the one you saw in class where you interpret the results of this hypothesis test.


### Plotting error bars

This exercise may take some time if you choose to pursue it.

Using Doll and Hill's smoking data and, construct a bar graph with accompanying error bars showing the proportion of study participants with lung cancer. 

To succeed in this exercise, you'll have to follow along careful with the Tutorial notes.  Please read the section titled "Plotting the table values with confidence".
