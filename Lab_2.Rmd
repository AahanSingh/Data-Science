For the first two problems we'll use the Cars93 data set from the MASS library.

```{r}
library(MASS)
```

#### 1. Manipulating data frames

There are certain situations where we want to transform right-skewed data before analysing it.  Taking the log of right-skewed data often helps to make it more normally distributed.

Here are histograms of the `MPG.highway` and `MPG.city` variables.

```{r, fig.width = 12}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))   # Display both plots in the same Figure, in 2 columns
hist(Cars93$MPG.city, col = "lightgray")
hist(Cars93$MPG.highway, col = "lightgray")
```

**(a)** Do the city and highway gas-mileage figures appear to have right-skewed distributions?

> Your answer: 

**(b)** Use the `transform()` and `log()` functions to create a new data frame called `Cars93.log` that has `MPG.highway` and `MPG.city` replaced with `log(MPG.highway)` and `log(MPG.city)`.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(c)** Run the histogram commands again, this time using your new `Cars93.log` dataset instead of `Cars93`.  

```{r, fig.width = 12}
# Edit me
```

**(d)** Do the distributions appear less skewed than before?

#### 2. Table function

**(a)** Use the `table()` function to tabulate the data by DriveTrain and Origin.  

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(b)** Does it looks like foreign car manufacturers had different Drivetrain preferences compared to US manufacturers?

#### 3. Functions, lists, and if-else practice

**(a)** Write a function called `isPassingGrade` whose input `x` is a number, and which returns `FALSE` if `x` is lower than 50 and `TRUE` otherwise.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(b)** Write a function called `sendMessage` whose input `x` is a number, and which prints `Congratulations` if `isPassingGrade(x)` is `TRUE` and prints `Oh no!` if `isPassingGrade(x)` is `FALSE`.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

**(c)** Write a function called `gradeSummary` whose input `x` is a number.  Your function will return a list with two elements, named `letter.grade` and `passed`.  The letter grade will be `"A"` if `x` is at least `90`.  The letter grade will be `"B"` if `x` is between `80` and `90`.  The letter grade will be `"F"` if `x` is lower than `"80"`.  If the student's letter grade is an A or B, `passed` should be TRUE; `passed` should be FALSE otherwise.

```{r}
# Edit me
```

To check if your function works, try the following cases:

`x = 91` should return 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
list(letter.grade = "A", passed = TRUE)
```

`x = 62` should return 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
list(letter.grade = "F", passed = FALSE)
```
